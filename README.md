# ON TRACK
This is the project for the app OnTrack, a map app that helps blind and visually impaired people to orientate and travel.</br>
# BIG IDEA
How can we help blind people to take public transports?
# RESEARCH
We interviewed 2 people at the Italian Union of the Blind and Partially Sighted people centre and we gathered informations on how we can help.

# CHARACTERISTICS
Our app provides the user not only with an itinerary but also with details about the trip/roads and a summary of the trip that they can look at without having to plan in advance. </br>
The app uses SpeechRecognition that is used to communicate where we want to go.</br>
VoiceOver.</br>
Geolocation to track the user's location.</br>
Satellite data **needs to still be implemented and worked on** to provide details about the trip.
